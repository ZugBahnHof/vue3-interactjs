# Getting Started

It's very simple to use this library.
You just need to import the library and use it in your Vue app.

```javascript
import { createApp } from "vue";
import VueInteractJs from "vue-interactjs";

const app = createApp({});

app.use(VueInteractJs);

// Now the app has started!
app.mount("#app");
```

Your HTML needs to look like this:

```html
<div id="#app">
  <!-- NOTE: here the outputs -->
</div>
```
